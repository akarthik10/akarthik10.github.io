  This page serves as an index for all of my personal projects.

* [**_Open Learn_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/rajeshwari) is an open-source school management system that transforms the way you manage your organization. Currently used by 12 schools in rural Karnataka, it allows you to manage student profile including student attendance, student exam report (SMS) and fee payment tracking (SMS).

* [**_Save to Google Drive_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/save_to_google_drive) is an extension for Mozilla Firefox using which you can save files that you find on the web directly to your Google Drive account - no need to download and upload it again. This can also detect all the images in a web page and batch-save them to your Google Drive account. This was featured in SoftPedia, [MakeTechEasier](https://www.maketecheasier.com/save-files-to-google-drive-firefox/) and several other review websites.

* [**_MapMe for s60v5_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/MapMe) is one of the very first mobile applications that I created, using QtSDK in C++ and QML to run on Symbian s60 Devices (includes Nokia 5800 XM). This can track or report your location to a known server (or your public Google Maps account). This uses Cell ID triangulation technique by requesting the network Cell ID of nearest transmitting Cell Towers and calculating an approximate user location. One can build a database of Cell IDs or consult an open-source database for detecting Cell ID location (or maybe use multiple for better accuracy). Apart from Cell ID, this also uses Mobile Country Code (MCC), Mobile Network Code (MNC), Location Area Code (LAC) for better accuracy.

* [**_PHP for Google App Engine_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/gae-php) is what I worked on before Google introduced PHP as an officially supported language for the Google App Engine. This a wrapper around GAE SDK to allow running PHP using Quercus, which uses Java under the hood. 

* I used [**_Captcha2Text_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/Captcha2Text) to decode some basic captcha images for my page scraping applications. This does not use any advanced image processing algorithms, or any other OCR techniques. It requires you to build a hash list of known letters after which any re-occurance of that letter is automatically detected.

* [**_e-Odyssey_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/e-Odyssey) is the website (script!) I created for e-Odyssey, the computer science club of our college. Completely written in Google Apps Script, you do not need a hosting space or a server to host this for processing. This script also has a XML import function that can fetch posts from a blog and can act as an index for all of its posts.
