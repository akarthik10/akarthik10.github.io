* [**_Open Learn_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/rajeshwari) is an open source school management system that transforms the way you manage your organization. Currently used by 12 schools in rural Karnataka, it allows you to manage student profile including student attendance, student exam report (SMS) and fee payment tracking (SMS).

* [**_Save to Google Drive_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/save_to_google_drive) is an extension for Mozilla Firefox using which you can save files that you find on the web directly to your Google Drive account - no need to download and upload it again. This can also detect all the images in a web page and batch-save them to your Google Drive account. This was featured in SoftPedia, [MakeTechEasier](https://www.maketecheasier.com/save-files-to-google-drive-firefox/) and several other review websites.

* [**_PHP for Google App Engine_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/gae-php) is what I worked on before Google introduced PHP as an officially supported language for the Google App Engine. This a wrapper around GAE SDK to allow running PHP using Quercus, which uses Java under the hood.
