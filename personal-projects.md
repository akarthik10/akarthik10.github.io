* [**_Open Learn_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/rajeshwari) is an open-source school management system that transforms the way you manage your organization. Currently used by 12 schools in rural Karnataka, it allows you to manage student profile including student attendance, student exam report (SMS) and fee payment tracking (SMS).

* [**_Save to Google Drive_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/save_to_google_drive) is an extension for Mozilla Firefox using which you can save files that you find on the web directly to your Google Drive account - no need to download and upload it again. This can also detect all the images in a web page and batch-save them to your Google Drive account. This was featured in SoftPedia, [MakeTechEasier](https://www.maketecheasier.com/save-files-to-google-drive-firefox/) and several other review websites.

* [**_MapMe for s60v5_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/MapMe) is one of the very first mobile applications that I created using Qt SDK in C++ and QML to run on Symbian s60 devices. This can track or report your location without using GPS using Cell ID triangulation technique by requesting the network Cell ID of nearest transmitting cell towers and by calculating an approximate user location. Apart from Cell ID, this also uses Mobile Country Code (MCC), Mobile Network Code (MNC), Location Area Code (LAC) for better accuracy.

* [**_PHP for Google App Engine_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/gae-php) is what I worked on before Google introduced PHP as an officially supported language for the Google App Engine. This a wrapper around GAE SDK to allow running PHP using Quercus, which uses Java under the hood. 

* [**_Omniscient_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/Omniscient) is a fun project I created that can accept user queries in natural language and can respond back with relevant answers, using Wolfram Aplha. Omnsicient can be accessed using [this link](http://omniscient-web.appspot.com).

* [**_Omniscient Android_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/Omniscient_android) is the android version of Omniscient for Web. This application can take user queries and respond back with relevant information.

* I used [**_Captcha2Text_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/Captcha2Text) to decode some basic captcha images for my page scraping applications. This does not use any advanced image processing algorithms, or any other OCR techniques. It requires you to build a hash list of known letters after which any re-occurance of that letter is automatically detected. But, please be sure to ask the site owner's permissions before using this.

* [**_e-Odyssey_**](https://github.com/akarthik10/e-Odyssey) is the website (script!) I created for e-Odyssey, the computer science club of our college. Completely written in Google Apps Script, you do not need a hosting space or a server to host this for processing. This script also has a XML import function that can fetch posts from a blog and can act as an index for all of its posts.
